\title{Rhinograd Simulated Repeated Measures Data}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 rows (10 replicates x 100 species) and 6 columns:
\describe{
\item{SP}{Character. Species names matching the tip labels in \code{rhino.tree}. Each species appears 10 times.}
\item{BM}{Numeric. Body mass (repeated measurements)}
\item{LS}{Numeric. Litter size (repeated measurements)}
\item{NL}{Numeric. Nose length (repeated measurements)}
\item{DD}{Numeric. Dispersal distance (repeated measurements)}
\item{RS}{Numeric. Range size (repeated measurements)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated based on Gonzalez-Voyer & von Hardenberg (2014) data.
}
\usage{
RhinoMulti.dat
}
\description{
A simulated dataset containing repeated measurements of life-history traits for 100 Rhinograd species.
This dataset is in "long" format, with 10 observations per species, suitable for testing
measurement error models using \code{variability = "reps"}.
}
\details{
This dataset was simulated by adding white noise to the original \code{rhino.dat} species values.
It represents a scenario where each species has 10 independent observations for each trait.
This allows using the \code{variability = "reps"} option in \code{because()} to explicitly model measurement error.

The underlying causal model is the same as for \code{rhino.dat}.
