### Phylogenetic Bayesian Structural Equation Module for ‘because’

`because.phybase` extends the
[because](https://github.com/because-pkg/because) package with support
for phylogenetic covariance structures. It implements S3 methods for
`phylo` and `multiPhylo` objects from the `ape` package, enabling
Bayesian Structural Equation Models (SEMs) with
phylogeneticaly-structured residuals (PhyBaSE, von Hardenberg &
Gonzalez-Voyer, 2025).

## Features

- **Phylogenetic Covariance**: Incorporates phylogenetic relatedness
  into `because` models.
- **Phylogenetic Uncertainty**: Supports `multiPhylo` objects to account
  for uncertainty in tree topology or branch lengths.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work transparently with
  `because` via S3 method dispatch.

## Installation

To install `because.phybase`, run:

``` r
remotes::install_github("because-pkg/because.phybase")
```

Note: This package requires the main **because** package to be
installed.

``` r
remotes::install_github("because-pkg/because")
```
